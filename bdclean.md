## Overview

`bdclean` is a user-friendly data cleaning Shiny app for the inexperienced R user. It provides features to manage complete workflow for biodiversity data cleaning, from uploading the data; collecting user input - in order to adjust cleaning procedures; cleaning the data; and finally, generating various reports and several versions of the data.
In order for `bdclean` to truly be practical, several unique and challenging R components were developed, such as a questionnaire module and high-quality reports mechanism. Also, since `bdclean` was developed for the inexperienced R user in mind, `bdclean` GUI must be exceptionally intuitive.
