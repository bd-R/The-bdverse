## Overview

bdDwC is an R package that supplies a Shiny app and a set of functions for standardizing field names according to the Darwin Core (DwC) format. Running bdDwC enables you to carefully standardize all field names in your dataset â€“ which allows the bdverse to handle data from various biodiversity portals, and lets you enjoy all of its features, regardless of publishers variation in field names.
