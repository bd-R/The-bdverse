We did not yet start working on `bdutilities`. We plan to explore the following elements in the next development phase of `bdverse`:

* Implementation of Shiny modules.
* R based <a href="https://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/Developer_Documentation" target="_blank">Kurator actors</a>: explore the development of R actors that will be integrated into the <a href="https://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/" target="_blank">kurator infrastructure</a>.
* Big-data in R: explore data capacity enhancement across the `bdverse`.
* Implementation of parallel processing.
* Implementation of ‘parallel universes’: with one simple setting, adjusting all `bdverse` features to a specific audience (see `bdclean` Future Plans section).
