## The `bdverse` main challenge
* Building and maintaining a 'house of cards', due to the massive dependencies between R packages.

## Development strategy

* Our focal point for the near future is: **QA+CI+GUI**. Our efforts will be focused on developing a robust quality assurance (QA) framework; implementing continuous integration (CI) across the `bdverse`; and enhance the GUI as much as possible.
* We also hope to start experimenting with implementing Shiny modules.

**Our plans for the next development phase are**:

* To identify key missing features, and address them using three GSoC projects.
* To establish one more GSoC project, that will be devoted to purely experimental challenges.
